        <h2>Experience and Goals</h2>
		<p>In my experience with Computer Science, I have taken classes such as <a href="https://compassxe-ssb.tamu.edu/StudentRegistrationSsb/ssb/tamuPublicProfile/viewSyllabus?crn=31240&term=201831">Intro to
		Program Design and Concepts</a>, <a href="https://compassxe-ssb.tamu.edu/StudentRegistrationSsb/ssb/tamuPublicProfile/viewSyllabus?crn=22891&term=201831">Discrete Structures of Computing</a> (Discrete Math), <a href="https://compassxe-ssb.tamu.edu/StudentRegistrationSsb/ssb/tamuPublicProfile/viewSyllabus?crn=23974&term=201911">Data 
		Structures and Algorithms</a>, <a href="https://compassxe-ssb.tamu.edu/StudentRegistrationSsb/ssb/tamuPublicProfile/viewSyllabus?crn=10937&term=201931">Computer Organization</a>, and Programming Languages, and
		am currently taking <a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/tanzir/sp20/313/">Intro to Computer Systems</a> and <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~rob.light/spring2020/csce315/">Programming Studio</a>. These 
		classes have taught me the basics of C++, Scheme, and Java, as well as given me 
		background in program and algorithm design and analysis, processor design, and 
		the basics of how programming languages operate and communicate with the 
		processor. Along with the languages previously mentioned, I have some 
		experience working with C# and Python, although not as extensive as my 
		experience with the others. Outside of school, I have worked as an intern in 
		the IT department for <a href="https://bioworldmerch.com/">Bioworld Merchandising</a> 
		in Dallas, Texas. This has provided me with experience of working as part of a 
		team in a real world working environment and communicating technical information
		with people in other departments with less technical experience and knowledge, 
		as well more general problem solving skills. My goal with Computer Science is to
		learn as much as I can and use my experience in the real world to make an impact on the 
		world. While most of my experience at this point is in the classroom, so many 
		different parts of society today rely heavily on computers and present me 
		endless opportunity to translate the knowledge I have and will accumulate to 
		something that will allow me to help people, even in a way that may not be 
		visible to most people. As of right now, my interests lie primarily in the 
		fields of software engineering and cybersecurity, although operating systems 
		and AI also interest me. Further into my college career, I will be taking 
		courses in all of these disciplines, giving me background knowledge to learn 
		and adapt to anything that I am needed to do.</p>
